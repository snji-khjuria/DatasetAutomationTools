# Extract a Depth Map From a Photo
Certain cameras, especially in phones, can attach a depth information to a JPG file. How can we extract that depth map and save it for further usage?
Go to , press File - Open, and select a JPG photo from your device. You should see layers on the right side (if it is hidden, press Window - Layers). You will see a depth map layer, and possibly a sharp version of your image, too.
Press "the eye icon" next to a layer to unhide it. Once visible, press File - Export as - JPG, to save a JPG version of your depth map. And we are done! :)
