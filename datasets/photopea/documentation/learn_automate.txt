# Automate
There are several ways to **automate** your work in Photopea.
  * - record your work as a sequence of steps, apply these steps later
  * - write a script (program code), which can process the document
  * - define several variables. Then, give Photopea a spreadsheet with different values for each variable, to produce different versions of your work
