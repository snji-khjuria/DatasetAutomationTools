# Convert Figma to PSD
Figma is a popular tool for creating user interfaces. But it can not export into a PSD format, and Adobe Photoshop can not open FIG files. But you can do it automatically as described below.
## FIG to PSD
At the moment, Photopea is the best tool for converting Figma FIG documents to Photoshop PSD files. Open to start a free online photo editor.
Load a Figma file from your device: press **File - Open** (in the top left corner) and find and select a Figma file (or use ).
The content of a Figma file (all pages and artboards) should be in front of you. You can click **File - Save As PSD** and get a PSD version of your file :)
## Missing fonts
If you use any special fonts in your Figma file, load them into Photopea with File - Open (and select TTF or OTF files). Photopea will use these fonts to redraw the corresponding text layers.
An example of the same Figma file in Photopea and Figma: the layer structure is preserved.
