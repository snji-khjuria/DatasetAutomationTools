# Vectorize Raster Images Online
Often, we see images, that were originally made as vector graphics, but are only available as a PNG or JPG file. Recreating such image by hand can take a lot of time. How can we do it faster?
## Converting Raster Graphics to Vectors
Vectorization (or image tracing) can be done online for free. Go to . Press File - Open, and open your raster image. Next, press **Image - Vectorize Bitmap**.
Here, we can see two previews: the original raster image on the left side, and the new vector image on the right side. You can zoom in and out with a mouse wheel, and move the preview by dragging it (both previews are zoomed and moved simultaneously).
When the vector result does not look perfect, you can improve it by changing settings. Set the **Number of colors** to tell Photopea, how many colors should the result have. You can also enable or disable **Noise reduction** (it is appropriate for natural photos).
## Save The Result
When the result looks well, press the **OK** button to confirm the vectorization. Now, just press File - Export As - **PDF** , **SVG** or **EMF**. And we are done! :)
