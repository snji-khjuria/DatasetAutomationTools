# Blending (Blur) Brush In Photopea / Photoshop
We often paint with a small number of colors, and later, we want to blend the edges between the colors, to create a blurry effect. How can we do it?
We can acheive this using the **Smudge tool**.
Increase the Size of the brush and set the **Hardness** to zero.
Now, open the Brush window (Window - Brush) and enable **Scatter**. Set Position Jitter to 10% and Count to 2. Now, you are ready to paint! :)
