# Open INDD files without InDesign
is a popular desktop publishing software, which creates files with the INDD extension. You can open INDD files easily in your web browser, or convert INDD to PSD files, for free! :)
## Just drag and drop a file!
Open , press File - Open, and select any INDD file. Alternatively, you can drag-and-drop a INDD file from your local computer into a browser window (running Photopea).
You should see the content of a file in front of you, together with a list of layers (pages, shapes, text layers) on the right side. Next, you can save it as a PSD (File - Save as PSD), or export it as a JPG, PNG or any other popular image format (File - Export As - ...).
