# Add GIF Into a Still Image
Do you want to decorate a still image with an animated GIF? Here is how to do it fast and for free :)
## Open your images
First, go to . Press File - Open, and open your still image. You can press Image - Image size, to change the resolution of the final GIF. Make sure it is not too large (e.g. Width and Height are < 1000 px). Large resolutions require a lot of RAM, the process may crash on phones.
Then, press File - Open, again, and open your GIF. You should see two panels ("tabs") in Photopea.
### Duplicate layers
Now, we need to copy all layers of the second document (frames of animation) into the first document (still image). Look into the Layers panel (bottom right): there is a folder (named "animated" in our case), that contains all frame layers.
Now, right-click that folder (in Layers panel) and choose Duplicate Into.
In the new window, choose the document with the still image as a destination. Confirm with OK button.
### Move the GIF to the right spot
Switch to the panel ("tab") with a still image. You will see your GIF in the top left corner. Disable "auto-select" at the top. Now, click and drag it to a new position (notice, that a whole folder is highlighted, so you are moving all frames at the same time).
You can even use to make the GIF larger / smaller, or rotate it, etc.
Now, press File - Export As - GIF, and ... a new animation is ready! Hit Save to save it :)
