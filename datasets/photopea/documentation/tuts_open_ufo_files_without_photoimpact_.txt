# Open UFO files without PhotoImpact
was a popular photo editor, which created files with the UFO extension. You can open UFO files easily in your web browser, or convert UFO to PSD files, for free! :)
## Just drag and drop a file!
Open , press File - Open, and select your UFO file. Alternatively, you can drag-and-drop a UFO file from your local computer into a browser window (running Photopea).
You should see the UFO image in front of you, together with a list of layers on the right side. Next, you can save it as a PSD (File - Save as PSD), or export it as a JPG, PNG or any other popular image format (File - Export As - ...).
