# Edit Smart Objects with a Script
Let's have a look at how we can edit Smart Objects from a Script in Photopea or Photoshop.
The basic DOM (Document Object Model) allows us working with a document, create and edit layers, modify their properites, etc. But there are many operations, for which appropriate DOM commands do not exist.
Photopea and Photoshop can . An action (one step) consists of two parts:
  * **Name** - a string of text, such as "make", "select", etc.
  * **Descriptor** - a structured object with additional parameters of the action


We can create an action (its name and a descriptor) inside a script. Then, it can be executed using `executeAction(Name, Descriptor)`.
## Open, edit and save a Smart Object
The action **placedLayerEditContents** corresponds to opening a Smart Object.
```
// select a layer that you want to work with
var l = app.activeDocument.layers.getByName("arrow");
app.activeDocument.activeLayer = l;
executeAction(stringIDToTypeID("placedLayerEditContents")); 
// now, the Smart Object is an active document, we can work with it
app.activeDocument.activeLayer.rotate(90);
// save the smart object and close it
app.activeDocument.save();
app.activeDocument.close();

```

## Convert a layer into a Smart Object
The action **newPlacedLayer** corresponds to clicking Layer - Convert to Smart Object.
```
// select a layer that you want to work with
var l = app.activeDocument.layers.getByName("ground");
app.activeDocument.activeLayer = l;
executeAction(stringIDToTypeID("newPlacedLayer"));

```
