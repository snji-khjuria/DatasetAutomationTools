# Convert many JPGs to PDF Online
Did you ever want to turn multiple JPG images into one PDF file? It is very simple!
Open and press File - Automate - PDF Presentation.
Click "Source Images" and select multiple images from your computer. You can select JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, or any other raster format. You can select the size of a page of your PDF, e.g. A4 in a portrait / landscape mode, or adapt each page to the image.
Once you are done, click **Export PDF** , and that is it! The original quality is preserved, without any re-encoding. E.g. if your JPG images were 5 MB in total, the resulting PDF is also 5 MB.
You have learned how to combine multiple images into a PDF document. You can even merge different formats or different resolutions. And best of all, there is no upload, it works even offline: you can open Photopea.com, disconnect from the internet, select JPGs from your computer, export a PDF, close Photopea and connect back again.
