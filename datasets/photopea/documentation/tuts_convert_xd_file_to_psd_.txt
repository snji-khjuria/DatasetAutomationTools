# Convert XD file to PSD
We may need to work with Adobe XD graphics in Photoshop. Adobe XD does not provide a PSD export, and Photoshop does not provide an XD import. Converting it manually would take too much time, but it can be done automatically, see how!
## XD to PSD
Today (the beginning of 2020), Photopea is the best tool to convert XD graphics to Photoshop files. Go to to start a free online photo editor. If you see a Welcome Screen, you can close it by pressing the Cross in the top right corner.
Open an XD file from your computer: click **File - Open** (in the top left corner), then, find and select the XD file (or use ).
You should see the graphics of your XD file in front of you. Now, just click **File - Save As PSD**. And that's all! So simple :)
