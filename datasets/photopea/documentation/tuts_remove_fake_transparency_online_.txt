# Remove Fake Transparent Background
There are many images with a fake transparency (white / grey checkerboard) in them. They are often **JPG** , or even **PNG** with no true transparency. It is very easy to get rid of that checkerboard pattern!
Go to , press File > Open, and open your image. Then, press Select > Magic Cut. You will see your image, and a final version next to it (if it is incorrect, look at our ).
Confirm it with the "OK" button. Now, hit File - Export As - PNG, and you are done :)
Here is a GIF version.
