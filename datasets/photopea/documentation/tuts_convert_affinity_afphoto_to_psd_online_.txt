Did you ever need to view the Affinity file, or convert it to a PSD? You can make it easily with !
After opening , press File - Open, and choose the Affinity file from your computer. Photopea works locally (no upload), so even a 100 MB file can be opened in under a second.
You can analyze your file, see layers and other content. Press File - Save as PSD, to save it as a PSD to your computer, and that's it! You can view that PSD later in Photopea, Adobe Photoshop, or other programs supporting the PSD format.
