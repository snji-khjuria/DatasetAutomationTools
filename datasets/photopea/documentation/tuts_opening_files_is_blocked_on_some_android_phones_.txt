# Opening files is blocked on some Android phones
Some Android devices had an update, which does not allow Photopea to open files from the "downloads" folder. It is known to happen on these devices: Xiaomi, Samsung S24, Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite.
## Solutions
  * Keep your files in some different folder, which is not named "downloads".
  * Load files by pressing File - Open More - From Any Folder.
