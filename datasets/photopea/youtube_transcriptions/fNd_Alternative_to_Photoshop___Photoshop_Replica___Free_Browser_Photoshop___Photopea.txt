If you want to use Photoshop for free any time anywhere, there is a free alternative called PhotoP, which is the browser-based image editor, which looks very similar to the Photoshop.
You can also say it as a duplicate version of Photoshop.
You can see the tools which are very similar to the Photoshop.
Even filters, layer options and many other things that are very similar to the Photoshop.
You can also open PSD file, AA file, XT file and even GIM file inside this PhotoP editor.
You can also save the final output as PSD file, which is very helpful to work afterwards in Photoshop.
Because this is the browser-based image editor, you can use this editor anytime,
anywhere in the device that supports browser function.
You can use it on Windows Mac for even Android devices.
I am going to post more tutorial on this editor.
So please do subscribe.
