Hi guys, this is Daniel from F&A. In this video, I'm going to show you how to remove background using a pen tool in photopy. So let's get started.
First, open photopy.com in your browser and drag on drop your image inside it.
So in this image, I'm going to remove the background and extract the person from it. Let's select the pen tool.
The shortcut for the pen tool is P and draw the path around the person to zoom in press control
plus to move use space bar and use the mouse to move and add path around our subject.
Click and drag to add the notes and change the fill type to none. Control plus to zoom in and control
minus to zoom out. Make a curve using pen tool whenever it is necessary. Press alt and you can drag like this.
Make sure your path is slightly inside the subject and click on the first anchor point to finish the loop.
Now we just created a path. Now we need to change this shape to path and click on make selection
select the first mode and click okay. Control plus zero to make the image to fit.
Now select our image and press control plus j to duplicate only the selection. Now if I hide the background
you can see our person is extracted from the background. So you can delete this shape layer.
Now you can go to file, export us and export it as P and G to get the transparent image.
So that's it. This is the way you can remove background in photography using pen tool.
